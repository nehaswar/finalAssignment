I'm Neha Swar from Kathmandu. I'm currently pursuing my BIM from St.Xavier's College.
The 3 days Git and Github training was a wonderful experiences.
This session helped to gain basic knowledge and learn the working process of Git and Github.
I hope there ould be more advance session on Git and Github.
I would like to thank the team of Genese Cloud Academy for providing me such an amazing platform and would like to thank Mr.Milan Thapa sir for training us.
